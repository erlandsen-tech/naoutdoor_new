                        Most of us do not have to think twice about this question.
                        We know! Our whole life and thinking was centered in drugs
                        in one form or anotherâ€”the getting and using and finding
                        ways and means to get more. We lived to use and used
                        to live. Very simply, an addict is a man or woman whose
                        life is controlled by drugs. We are people in the grip of a
                        continuing and progressive illness whose ends are always
                        the same: jails, institutions, and death.
